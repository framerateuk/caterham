This is the story of our Caterham.

I'd wanted a Lotus since playing Lotus Turbo Challenge II on the Amiga.
But they were always so impractical so I stuck to hot hatchbacks.

I eventually got the trackday bug.

I met my girlfriend, Eleri; and took her along to trackdays in my Megane 250.

I got to realise the high costs of trackdays in a heavy hatchback! {show ripped tyre}

We hired some cars at Caterham South for my Dad's 60th Birthday. A soon as I climbed in, I knew this was something special. The seating position and environment seemed completely alien to me, but the connection it gave to the car was unreal.

We drove down to Eastbourne in what would be one of the most memorable drives of our lifes. How on earth could 125bhp feel so fast?!

I was looking for cars as soon as we got back, and a perfrectly timed redundancy payout at work gave us the funds we needed!

Within a month we were on our way down to Tunbridge Wells to collect would would become our Caterham - A highly specced Roadsport 140 with quite literally every option we were looking for.

The car has come a long with since and has had a lot of fixes and upgrades, but still remains true to the original Caterham SuperSport spec - which for me really hits the spot as road car and makes you work hard on a track!
